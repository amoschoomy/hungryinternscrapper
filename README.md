# hungryinternscrapper

Simple Python script to scrap candidates data that has been in the open in [Hungry Intern](https://hungryintern.com/candidate-listing/)

Example data contains candidate personal information such as name, address and phone number. Due to the inconsistent formatting and lack of completeness, 
some data might be missing in the candidate.

To run this script you need to install [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Chrome Driver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads).
Place the Chrome Driver executable file in the directory where this script is stored.

Follow this steps here to run a Python script 
[Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html)
[Mac](https://docs.python.org/3/using/mac.html)

Data scrapped will be exported to a csv file.
